## Overview

a beginner challenge to build a qr-code component on front-end mentor.io. A great newbie challenge that requires the use of a few basic CSS properties. The Layout was created and centered using flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this being one of my first practice projects, the best thing i learnt was how easy it is to center divs using flexbox with the justify-content and align items properties. Example of container below:

.container {
width: 100%;
height: 100vh;
background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
}

### Continued development

In future projects i would like to build more complex layouts using flexbox, but also CSS grid. I also think i need to organise my code better with a workflow and possibly implement a font-size and spacing system.
